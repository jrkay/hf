who tries to be the stable clown
who catches the eye of all the visitors
who enjoys large mudpuddles more than anything
who thinks they can see ghosts
who thinks they are a human-whisperer
who is unusually good at bucking
who insists their halter matches their mane
who can drink out of a straw
who tries to lick everything
who is already skilled at pirouettes
who pouts a lot
who can't keep their front feet on the ground
who is terrified of cats
who doesn't have a good attention span
who is a bit of a bully
who has already tried to jump the fence
who doesn't trust kids
who is trying very hard to please mom
who gets worried easily
who can't concentrate very well
who already figured out Algebra
who acts like they're retired
who is quite enthusiastic about jumping over water
who would look good in a cape
